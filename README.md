=================

This plugin created a report from a dita documentation. The report is a DITA documentation itself.

Current report:
- Audience Applicability Report


Audience Applicability Report

The report generate a concept file containing a table. The header is the topic title followed by one column per available audience.

Then each row contains the topic title and the value yes or no if the topic has the audience set or not.

The audience list is generated by the audience element found in the main ditama

```xml
<topicmeta>
    <audience name="myaudience" type="user" />
    <audience name="mysndaudience" type="user" />
</topicmeta>            
```
